    """ For historical reasons, OpenERP has weird dealings in relation to
    view_mode and the view_type attribute (on window actions):

    * one of the view modes is ``tree``, which stands for both list views
      and tree views
    * the choice is made by checking ``view_type``, which is either
      ``form`` for a list view or ``tree`` for an actual tree view

    This methods simply folds the view_type into view_mode by adding a
    new view mode ``list`` which is the result of the ``tree`` view_mode
    in conjunction with the ``form`` view_type.

    TODO: this should go into the doc, some kind of "peculiarities" section
